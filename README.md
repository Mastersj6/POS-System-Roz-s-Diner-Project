# POS-System-Roz-s-Diner-Project
A point of Sale/Online ordering system for a local diner

This project started once my group decided to choose a local diner for our business to improve. Our plan was to create an online ordering system that allows
customers and employees to create accounts. Customers are able to look at the menu, create an order, pay for the order, then go pick up the order when it is ready.
The employees are able to see orders, update order progress, and check overall order statistics for the restaurant.

Creating a MySQL database was the first step in the development. Then creating data in order to prepare for the actual interface using Visual Studio.
